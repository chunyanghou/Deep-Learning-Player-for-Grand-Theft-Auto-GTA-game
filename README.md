# Deep-Learning-Player-for-Grand-Theft-Auto-GTA-game
This project aims to explore the possibility of finding lanes in GTA through two methods. The first method is an image-based algorithm. We use OpenCV to grab the lane and drive on the correct lane. The second method is based on neural networks, we use TensorFlow to train our data, and finally realize autonomous driving.
